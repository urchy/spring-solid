# SOLID Principles on Spring-Boot
This repository is for an example application built in Spring Framework 5 to show how to implement SOLID principles.

There will be a branch for each concept.

First let starts with Spring Framework.

**1 - Spring Context**:
Spring contexts are also called Spring IoC containers, which are responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling beans by reading configuration metadata from XML, Java annotations, and/or Java code in the configuration files.
Spring Framework its responsible for instantiate all dependencies without our concern through IoC.

 
**2 - Dependecy Injection**
When you go and get things our of the regrigerator for yourself, you can cause problems. You might leave the door open, you might get something Mommy doesn't want you to have.
You might even be looking for something we don't even have or which has expired.
What you should be doing is stating a need: "I need something to drink with lunch" and then we will make sure you have something when you sit down to eat.
